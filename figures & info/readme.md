# TOPCON-MM Dataset

The TOPCON-MM dataset contains  paired fundus and OCT images from 369 eyes of 203 patients. There are eleven classes, including normal, dry age-related macular degeneration (dAMD), wet age-related macular degeneration (wAMD), diabetic retinopathy (DR), central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC), pigment epithelial detachment (PED), macular epiretinal membrane (MEM), fluid (FLD), exudation (EXU), choroid neovascularization (CNV) and retinal vascular occlusion (RVO).

The folders `fundus_images` and `oct_images` contain the original fundus photos and OCT scans respectively. Each image is named following the format `[patient_id]-[eye_side]-[scan_id]`.

The files `fundus_labels.csv` and `oct_labels.csv` contain the labels for the fundus images and OCT scans in our dataset.
